/*
  You have to predict the output of this program WITHOUT EXECUTING IT.

  In order to do this, try writing down the value that all variables take
  during each step of the program execution.

  Answer the following questions:

  1. This program throws an error. Why? (If you can't find it, try executing it).
  2. Remove the line that throws the error.
  3. What is printed to the console?
  4. How many times is "f1" called?
  5. How many times is "f2" called?
  6. What value does the "a" parameter take in the first "f1" call?
  7. What is the value of the "a" outer variable when "f1" is called for the first time?
*/

let x = 2;
let a = 6;

const f1 = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

const f2 = function (a, b) {
  return a + b + x;
};

console.log(x);
console.log(a);
//console.log(b);

for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
  a = a + 1;
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    const d = f2(i, x);
    console.log(d);
  } else {
    const e = f1(i, a);
    console.log(e);
  }
}


/*

  1. We are trying log the value of a variable (b) that doesn't exist within it's scope.
  2. I commented out line 31.
  3. the console should look as follows:
  2
  6
  4
  9
  6
  13
  8
  4. f1 is called twice.
  5. f2 is called 3 times.
  6. the a parameter the first time f1 is called will have the value 1.
  7. the a variable when f1 is called the first time will have the value 8.
